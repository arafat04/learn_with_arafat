# Time Hierarchy Therorem
It is about in terms computation of algorithms, there is a hierarchy among time complexities.

### Total Function:

A function f: N -> N (it is read f is a function from natural natural to natural number) is total  function if for every input x, a Turing Machine halts on x and decide it.
